## The project
The project lasted 2 days. We wanted to build something useful with an API that did not require authentication and that left room for creativity. After a brainstorming session we settled on a Weather app, which was later expanded to include news and random fact. 

*The MVP*
We decided that the MVP of a wether app has to:
* accept user input of location on the home page
* show the minimum and the max temperature for the day in their city
* as well as the description of the weather together with a gif of an animal to cheer them up

*MVP +*
As the MVP was completed we expanded the weather app to become a ’Start your day’ style apple added the following API’s to the app
* News API
* Quote of the Day API
* TFL API (only for London)
